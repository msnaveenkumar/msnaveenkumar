Subject: **Scheduled Reviews and Sub-Task Creation for QA Deployment**

Hi Team,

To ensure the quality and stability of our code before it reaches the QA environment, we are implementing a new process. Please follow the steps below before pushing any code into QA:

1. **Peer Developer Review**: Schedule a meeting for a peer review with another developer.
2. **QA Review**: Schedule a review session with a QA team member.
3. **BA Review**: Schedule a review session with a Business Analyst.

Additionally, each team member should create sub-tasks in Jira for these review sessions. This will help us track progress and ensure that all necessary steps are completed.

Thank you for your cooperation in maintaining the quality of our code.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
